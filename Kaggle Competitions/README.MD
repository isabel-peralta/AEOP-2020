# AEOP Internship 2020 - Kaggle Competitions 

The subject areas that we were introduced to were then built upon later mostly in the following Kaggle Competitions.
- Regression was used in the Housing Prices competition.
- Clustering was the method in the Tiatinic competition.
- The Digit Recognizer came with the introduction of neural networks. 

Each one of these competitions also required an understanding of data augmentation, image processing, feature engineering, and more. 

## Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
```

```
The objective of this competition was to predict the price of a house as it corresponds with a variety of factors including square-footage, quality scores and more.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
```
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
```
The objective of this competition was to predict whether or not a passenger, depending on qualities such as gender, age, and boarding class, would survive the sinking of the titanic based on data of who survived the crash. 

## Digit Recognizer
```

```
The objective of this task was to use deep neural networks to indentify images of handwritten numbers. Two versions of this program are saved, one using just one layer of dense neural networks and another using convolutional neural networks. 

To aid in further developing skills for this task, I used the 2017 cs231n Stanford University course.
